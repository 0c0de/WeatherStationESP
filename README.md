# Weather Station
Simple Weather Station just clone the repo and open the .ino project into Arduino IDE or PlatformIO(didn't try this yet!)

Some of the dependencies you need, I recommend installing these from Arduino IDE is much simpler:
- ArduinoJSON -> For manipulating the responses of the server: https://arduinojson.org/
- Fetch -> For an easier http request, very similar to the fetch API of Javascript: https://github.com/instanceofMA/arduino-fetch
- Adafruit GFX -> For the screen to work: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library
- Adafruit_ST7789 -> For the specific driver I did use: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-ST7735-Library
